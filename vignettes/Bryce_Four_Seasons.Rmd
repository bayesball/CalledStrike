Collect Harper data for four seasons:

```{r}
library(CalledStrike)
bh <- collect_4_years("Bryce Harper")
```

Illustrate filled contour plots on different measures of hitting.

In-play hit rate:

```{r}
contour_plot_p4_fill(bh, type = "h")
```

In-play home run rate:

```{r}
contour_plot_p4_fill(bh, type = "hr")
```

Missed in a swing rate:

```{r}
contour_plot_p4_fill(bh, type = "ms",
           P = c(.1, .15, .20, .25, .3, .35, .4))
```

Called strike rate:

```{r}
contour_plot_p4_fill(bh, type = "cs")
```

Swing rate:

```{r}
contour_plot_p4_fill(bh, type = "sw")
```

Launch speed:

```{r}
contour_plot_m4_fill(bh, type = "ls",
                     M = seq(75, 95, 5))
```

Spray angle:

```{r}
contour_plot_m4_fill(bh, type = "sa")

```

Launch angle:

```{r}
contour_plot_m4_fill(bh, type = "la")
```
